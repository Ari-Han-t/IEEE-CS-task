Doubly Linked List in C

Overview
This is a simple **Doubly Linked List (DLL) implementation in C. 
It allows you to:  
- Insert elements at the head or tail  
- Print the list forward and backward 
- Run a menu-driven program that keeps running until you exit  

It's a basic implementation, nothing fancy, but it does the job. If you want to improve it, feel free to add more features.

Features:
- Insert at the **head** (O(1))  
- Insert at the **tail** (O(n) because we have to traverse the list)  
- Print the list in **forward and backward** directions  
- Simple **menu-driven interface**
