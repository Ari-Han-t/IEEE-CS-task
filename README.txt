This is a simple implementation of a stack in C language.
I have tried to get the input from the user dynamically, where I have used a switch case to get the user choice and calling functions according to their input.
 
A stack has all sorts of uses. From what I have learnt, in DSA a stack is used to convert infix operations to postfix and prefix expressions, also in Depth First Search in graphs or Binary Search trees. Stacks are one of the most basic data structures which is used in solving numerous problems in a computer and in our daily life too.


Time and space complexities:
Push(x): O(1) time, O(n) space
Pop(): O(1) time, O(n) space
Top(): O(1) time, O(1) space
isEmpty(): O(1) time, O(1) space
isFull(): O(1) time, O(1) space
getMin(): O(1) time, O(n) space
getMax(): O(1) time, O(n) space
